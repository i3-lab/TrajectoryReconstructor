### Overview
TrajectoryReconstructor is a [3D Slicer](http://slicer.org) Module for MR tracking and trajectory reconstruction.

### Usage:
1. Install the dependent [SlicerOpenIGTLink](https://github.com/openigtlink/SlicerOpenIGTLink), [Sequence](https://github.com/SlicerRt/Sequences) and [CurveMaker](https://github.com/tokjun/CurveMaker) extensions.
   If you are using Slicer Version earlier than 4.9.0, SlicerOpenIGTLink extension is not required.

2. After install the extensions, the user need to switch to the module `TrajectoryReconstructor`.

3. Setup the communication with the tracking data client using OpenIGTLinkIF panel, please refer to [SlicerOpenIGTLink](https://github.com/openigtlink/SlicerOpenIGTLink) for more information.

4. In the algorithm setting section. Kalman filter is used in the noise deduction, the user needs to set the parameters according to the measurement error and noise level. Two resampling parameters - MovementThreshold and ResampleWindowSize - can also be set here, if the mean position of points in the resampling window has a   movement larger than the threshold value, the point in this section with the largest movement Will be added to the downsampled points.  Also real-time trajectory reconstruc is possible by toggling the 'Real-time Reconstruct' checkbox.

5. Selector the locator to be tracked in the 'Locator' drop down selector.

6. Toggle the 'Record' checkbox, the transformation matrix of locator will be recorded and a tool representing the locator will be shown in the 3D view. Once the recording is finished, untoggle the 'Record' checkbox. 

7. Toggle the 'Replay' checkbox will replay the recorded tracking data. Make sure disconnect the communication with the tracking data client before toggling the replay checkbox, as the replay feature uses the same transformation node as the tracking data from client.

8. Export/Import using Slicer mrmlScene. Just save all the nodes and the mrmlScene in the same folder. Use the saved mrmlScene for importing.

9. Export to csv file. Choose the directory you would like to export the csv file.  Type the file name and click save.

10. Import csv file. Choose the csv file you would like to import.  Click Load button, a popup window will ask if you really want to proceed as the current mrmlScene will be cleared.
    After the file is loaded, you could click reconstruct button to reconstruct the trajectory and replay the sequence.
